# Supermarket Management System – Java (OOP)

This academic project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Afeka College.  
The system simulates a supermarket management environment, handling buyers, sellers, products, and shopping carts.  
It was designed using OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and implemented entirely in Java.

The project focuses on class hierarchy, exception handling, and logical relationships between real-world entities, providing a strong foundation for later database integration.
